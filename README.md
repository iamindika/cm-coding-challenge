# Work/Project Examples

## Hacker News Clone

[Live Site](https://astounding-puffpuff-302858.netlify.app/)\
[Github Repo](https://github.com/iamindika/hacker-news-clone-no-hooks)

Personal project created from the ground up. Project utilizes react classes and functions (no hooks) to present UI for new and top headlines retrieved from the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). 

Key learning points:
- Furthered my understanding of React Lifecycles.  
- Learnt about incorporating React Router and code splitting with React Lazy and Suspense.
- Learnt about React contexts to pass a theme prop anywhere in the component tree. 
- Please refer to [README](https://github.com/iamindika/hacker-news-clone-no-hooks/blob/main/README.md) for more details.

## Scheduler

[Github Repo](https://github.com/iamindika/scheduler) 

Bootcamp project.  Project utilizes react hooks to present UI for a weekly scheduling system. Project employs use of a backend api to fetch and modify appointments.  

Key learning points:
- First introduction to react hooks.
- First use of storybook to develop components composing an appointment window. 
- First use of [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) based testing.
- Please refer to [README](https://github.com/iamindika/scheduler/blob/master/README.md) for more details.

# Inspiration

  [Render Props vs React Hooks](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/render-props-vs-hooks-a73ec72180ed)

  I've always been curious if react hooks would completely take over react class components.  This goes on to show that although hooks provide a more efficient solution in most cases, there are some situations where react class components can still be viable.  Here render props is an react architecture that has been replaced with custom hooks.  However custom hooks can lead to more expensive calculations when a component's UI is complex which is where the react class based render props solution really shines.  It's nice to know that react class components are still viable since the introduction of the react hook api.  

  [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)

  NextJS is an interesting React extension that incorporates bundling, minifying, routing, and code splitting within this one framework. It has improved SEO by allowing to optionally render server side components or utilize static site generation. I believe it is a framework that has the potential to speed up project development and production. I can't wait to incorporate it into my own personal projects. 

# Focus

  At Critical Mass I would choose to focus my efforts on styling, testing and debugging. I would enjoy learning and building sophisticated web elements like toggles, navbars and transitions using just css.  I would also enjoy learning other styling tools like sass and styled components. I would like to learn more about common testing and debugging suites used in modern practice to build more reliable websites.  Once I become sufficient at frontend design I'd like to shift my focus to backend frameworks on my path to becoming a full-stack developer.
