# Work/Project Examples

# Inspiration

# Focus

  At Critical Mass I would choose to focus my efforts on styling, testing and debugging. I would enjoy learning and building sophisticated web elements like toggles, navbars and transitions using just css.  I would also enjoy learning other styling tools like sass and styled components. I would like to learn more about common testing and debugging suites used in modern practice to build more reliable websites.  Once I become sufficient at frontend design I'd like to shift my focus to backend frameworks on my path to becoming a full-stack developer.
