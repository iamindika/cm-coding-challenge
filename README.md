  [Render Props vs React Hooks](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/render-props-vs-hooks-a73ec72180ed)

  I've always been curious if react hooks would completely take over react class components.  This goes on to show that although hooks provide a more efficient solution in most cases, there are some situations where react class components can still be viable.  Here render props is an react architecture that has been replaced with custom hooks.  However custom hooks can lead to more expensive calculations when a component's UI is complex which is where the react class based render props solution really shines.  It's nice to know that react class components are still viable since the introduction of the react hook api.

# Focus

  At Critical Mass I would choose to focus my efforts on styling, testing and debugging. I would enjoy learning and building sophisticated web elements like toggles, navbars and transitions using just css.  I would also enjoy learning other styling tools like sass and styled components. I would like to learn more about common testing and debugging suites used in modern practice to build more reliable websites.  Once I become sufficient at frontend design I'd like to shift my focus to backend frameworks on my path to becoming a full-stack developer.
